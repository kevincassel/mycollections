VideoGame.create!(picture: "https://www.argusjeux.fr/medias/mario-kart-super-circuit-e58327.jpg" title:"Super Mario Kart", platform:"Game Boy Advance", category:"Good old times", editor:"Inteligent Systems", year: "2003", description:"Mario Kart: Super Circuit is a 2003 kart racing video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. The game is the third installment in the Mario Kart series and the first for handhelds, following Super Mario Kart (1992) and Mario Kart 64 (1996). Super Circuit is a kart racing video game in which the player races in a kart against other teams in different courses. The game screen indicates the current standings in a race, the number of laps needed to finish and incoming weapons. Like in the previous installments, players can pick up item boxes to receive a randomly selected item and use it to impede the opposition and gain the advantage. Some items, such as shells and banana peels, allow the player to hit others to slow them down, while other items, such as the star power-up, render them temporarily invincible to attacks. This is the second Mario Kart game to include coins, which increases the engine power of the karts.")

There are five historically based campaigns, which constrict the player to specialized and story-backed conditions.")

It was designed and directed by Fumito Ueda, who wanted to create a minimalist game around a boy meets girl concept. Originally planned for the PlayStation, Ico took approximately four years to develop. The team employed a subtracting design approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game's setting and story in order to create a high level of immersion.")

Wander must travel across a vast expanse on horseback and defeat sixteen massive beings, known simply as colossi, in order to restore the life of a girl named Mono. The game is unusual within the action-adventure genre in that there are no towns or dungeons to explore, no characters with whom to interact, and no enemies to defeat other than the colossi.")
